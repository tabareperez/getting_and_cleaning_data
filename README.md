# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
Tabare Perez : tabare.perez@gmail.com

You have to run the script **run_analysis.R** from **R** or
**RStudio** environment in your current directory.

The program download and unzip the data file and generates the final
tidy.txt with the results the project asks to obtain.

ATTENTION!!

If you are working on Linux, the URL of the file mus be the following:
http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

not **https:// ...**

The syntax for downloading the file must be:

**download.file(dataURL, destfile = dataFile)**

without **method = "curl"* parameter.

See the documentation on the script **run_analysis.R** to know how the
program works.

Thanks!!
