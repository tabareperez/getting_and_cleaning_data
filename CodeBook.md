==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the
data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into
body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to
have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was
obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency
domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

### For each record it is provided:

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration)
  and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on
  the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.

* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity
   name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their
descriptions are equivalent.

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who
  performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1
  to 30.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration
  signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity
  units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same
  description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and
  'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration
  signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total
  acceleration.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity
  vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units
  are radians/second.

### Notes: 
* Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
* Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
